# Covid-19-Language-Model

This small project seeks to prepare a language model using the relevant research papers and articles currently available pertaining to the ongoing global Covid-19 pandemic. A multitude of datasets is used for this language model, the main source being the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). It contains a collation of all the relevant and useful research papers on the topic. Further, I have also taken references from some Kaggle notebooks: [Xhlulu's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/cord-19-eda-parse-json-and-generate-clean-csv) provides the appropriate cleaned data that I required for the work and [Daniel Wolffram's notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/topic-modeling-finding-related-articles) talks about topic modelling and finding related articles and papers.
